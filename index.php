					<h1>Hello We Are Dadz</h1>
					<div class="left">
						<p>Dadz is the new Portland 3-piece pysch/garage/gaze band kindled from the embers of under-the-radar sonic purveyors, Eaglekin. Dadz' influences vary between the kinetic and angular guitar work of Television, the warbled voice of Jeff Mangum, the frenetic nocturne of Acid Mothers Temple, and the heavy riffs and extended jams of early Black Sabbath.</p>
						<p>Dadz explore the supermarket in the song "C-Town, Town, Town", celebrate the wonder of the feline species with the uplifting and danceable "Gpaw II", unleash face-melters like "Druid Archetypes," and cause eyes to dilate with the drawn out implosions they curate in "Black Dot."</p>
						<p>Dadz are currently booking shows at local clubs and want to share billings with similarly minded groups. Dadz are indeed dads. Dadz incorporate the simulacrum of noise and chaos into their everyday domestication process. There is beauty hidden under the shabby grey.</p>
